        Credit Policy </h2>

      <p class="white fw-300 fs-9 opacity-50">This policy outlines the requirements for establishing payment terms with the company's customers, as well as the monitoring of those terms.

      <p class="white fw-300 fs-9 opacity-50">The company will extend credit to customers if they meet its threshold criteria for the granting of credit. Customers can get up to 20% of their total monthly spend on web and or POS. The basic form of credit is a maximum of N250,000 and a minimum starting credit of N10,000 with no security interest. The maximum credit can be expanded with the approval of the credit manager. In situations where a customer's ability to repay is in question, a personal, corporate, or bank guarantee may be required. All terms are net 30 days, with no exceptions if a longer payment term is requested.</p><br>

      <p class="white fw-300 fs-9 opacity-50">The credit department will review the credit applications of all new customers after first 30 days to determine their worthiness to receive credit, and the amount of that credit. The credit level may be reduced if a customer has a low credit score on the credit report, if it has been formed within the past two years, or if its current ratio is less than 1:1.</p><br>

      <p class="white fw-300 fs-9 opacity-50">The credit department will periodically review the repayment history of existing customers to determine whether their existing credit levels are reasonable, or need to be revised. This review shall also be conducted whenever business conditions warrant a general retraction or expansion of credit levels.</p><br>

      <p class="white fw-300 fs-9 opacity-50">The terms of credit offered to customers are standardized under existing credit programs and promotions. The credit department will adjust standard terms of credit to maximize credit outcomes, though such changes require the approval of the credit manager.
